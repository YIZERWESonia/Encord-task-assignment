# Encord Task Assignment & QA Monitor

This project combines two key functions:

- **Task Assignment Automation**: Automates the reviewer assignment process in Encord, ensuring that no reviewer is assigned to tasks they originally annotated.
- **Annotation QA Monitoring**: Provides tools to track annotation quality using error metrics and reviewer feedback to improve overall label consistency.

Ideal for teams using Encord for structured annotation pipelines and quality control workflows.
